# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Overview
This project involves developing an algorithm to solve a competitive game scenario based on prime numbers. You will need to apply your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to determine the winner of a game that involves strategically removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## Project Timeline
- **Project Start:** August 6, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** August 9, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** August 7, 2024, 12:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Key Concepts

### Prime Numbers
- **Understanding Prime Numbers:** Learn what prime numbers are and how to identify them.
- **Efficient Prime Number Identification:** Implement efficient algorithms to find prime numbers within a given range.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Efficient Prime Identification:** Leverage the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a highly efficient algorithm, to identify all prime numbers up to a specified limit.

### Game Theory
- **Competitive Game Principles:** Understand the basics of competitive games where players take turns.
- **Optimal Play:** Learn strategies that lead to a win or loss based on the rules of the game.

### Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- **Optimizing Calculations:** Use previous results to accelerate future calculations, essential for optimizing multiple rounds of the game.

### Python Programming
- **Implementation:** Use loops, conditional statements, arrays, and lists in Python to implement game logic and algorithms.
